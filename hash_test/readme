1. 
string_hash() is good in distrubuting hashed items.
test1() uses a 1024-sized array to store collisions of hashed index. 
the number of strings to hash is 1024*1024. 
the result of arr[] are printed in output.
checking output find almost each item of arr[] are near 1024, which is a good result.

2.
need implement int32 hash, ipv4 addr hash, short16 hash.
maybe borrow from kernel?
