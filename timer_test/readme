1.  t1.c 
two fifo 
ctl fifo: add/del timer task ;
    when all timer tasks are done, and add a new task, need write to timer_fifo
timer fifo: use select, 
      when timeout, run all tasks that on time or passed the time;
      when fifo can read, need recalc tv which is passed to select

2. this example only handles timespec tv_sec, not tv_nsec.

3. t2.c
one fifo, one thread, no need for locks
use timer_fifo to serialize, all data (including pointer) were sent into fifo, then decode
in timer_loop().
